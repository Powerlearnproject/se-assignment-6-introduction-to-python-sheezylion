## 3. Python Syntax and Semantics:

### Question: Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

**Solution:**

Below is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```python
# Simple Python program to print "Hello, World!" to the console

# Print statement to display "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Explanation of Basic Syntax Elements:

1. **Comments (`#`)**:

   - Comments in Python start with the `#` symbol and are used to annotate code. They are ignored by the Python interpreter and are meant for human readers to understand the code.
   - Example: `# Simple Python program to print "Hello, World!" to the console`

2. **Print Statement (`print("Hello, World!")`)**:

   - The `print()` function in Python outputs text or other objects to the console (or standard output). In this case, it outputs the string `"Hello, World!"`.
   - The string `"Hello, World!"` is enclosed in double quotes (`"`), indicating it is a string literal.

3. **Whitespace and Indentation**:
   - Python uses indentation to indicate blocks of code (such as loops, functions, conditionals). This is unlike languages that use braces `{}` for this purpose.
   - In the example, there is no indentation needed for a simple script, but it becomes crucial when defining functions, loops, or conditional statements.

## 4. Data Types and Variables:

### Question: List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

**Solution**

In Python, the basic data types can be categorized into several main types. Here's a list and description of the commonly used ones:

1. **Integer (`int`)**:

   - Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without any decimal point.
   - Example: `x = 10`

2. **Float (`float`)**:

   - Represents real numbers with a decimal point.
   - Example: `y = 3.14`

3. **String (`str`)**:

   - Represents a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).
   - Example: `name = "John"`

4. **Boolean (`bool`)**:

   - Represents a value of either `True` or `False`.
   - Example: `is_valid = True`

5. **List (`list`)**:

   - Represents an ordered collection of items which can be of different data types.
   - Example: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

6. **Tuple (`tuple`)**:

   - Similar to a list but immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
   - Example: `coordinates = (10, 20)`

7. **Dictionary (`dict`)**:
   - Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
   - Example: `person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`

Now, let's demonstrate how to create and use variables of different data types in a short Python script:

```python
# Define variables of different data types
x = 10              # Integer
y = 3.14            # Float
name = "John"       # String
is_valid = True     # Boolean
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # List
coordinates = (10, 20)  # Tuple
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}  # Dictionary

# Print the variables and their types
print(f"x = {x}, type: {type(x)}")
print(f"y = {y}, type: {type(y)}")
print(f"name = {name}, type: {type(name)}")
print(f"is_valid = {is_valid}, type: {type(is_valid)}")
print(f"numbers = {numbers}, type: {type(numbers)}")
print(f"coordinates = {coordinates}, type: {type(coordinates)}")
print(f"person = {person}, type: {type(person)}")
```

### Output:

```
x = 10, type: <class 'int'>
y = 3.14, type: <class 'float'>
name = John, type: <class 'str'>
is_valid = True, type: <class 'bool'>
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4], type: <class 'list'>
coordinates = (10, 20), type: <class 'tuple'>
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}, type: <class 'dict'>
```

### Explanation:

- Each variable (`x`, `y`, `name`, `is_valid`, `numbers`, `coordinates`, `person`) is assigned a value of a specific data type.
- The `type()` function is used to determine and print the type of each variable.
- This script demonstrates the versatility of Python in handling different data types seamlessly and showcases how variables of each type can be defined and utilized.

Python's flexibility with data types and its straightforward syntax make it a powerful choice for a wide range of applications, from simple scripting to complex data processing and web development.

## 5. Control Structures:

### Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

**Conditional Statements and Loops in Python:**

### Conditional Statements (if-else):

Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The main types of conditional statements are `if`, `else`, and `elif` (short for "else if").

#### Example of an `if-else` Statement:

```python
# Example of an if-else statement
age = 25

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not yet an adult.")
```

#### Explanation:

- In this example, the variable `age` is assigned a value of `25`.
- The `if` statement checks if `age` is greater than or equal to `18`.
- If the condition (`age >= 18`) evaluates to `True`, the code inside the `if` block (`print("You are an adult.")`) is executed.
- If the condition is `False`, the code inside the `else` block (`print("You are not yet an adult.")`) is executed.

### Loops:

Loops in Python allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true (`while` loop) or for a fixed number of times (`for` loop).

#### Example of a `for` Loop:

```python
# Example of a for loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```

#### Explanation:

- In this example, `numbers` is a list containing integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The `for` loop iterates over each element (`num`) in the `numbers` list.
- During each iteration, the current value of `num` is printed using the `print(num)` statement.

#### Example of a `while` Loop:

```python
# Example of a while loop
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1
```

#### Explanation:

- This `while` loop continues to execute the block of code (`print(f"Count: {count}")`) as long as the condition (`count <= 5`) remains true.
- Initially, `count` is set to `1`.
- Inside the loop, the `count` variable is incremented by `1` (`count += 1`) after each iteration to eventually meet the exit condition (`count <= 5`).

### Summary:

- **Conditional statements** (`if-else`, `elif`) allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions.
- **Loops** (`for` loop, `while` loop) enable repetitive execution of code, iterating over sequences or while a condition is true.
- These constructs are fundamental in Python programming for controlling program flow and handling repetitive tasks efficiently. They contribute to Python's flexibility and ease of use in various applications, from simple scripts to complex algorithms and applications.
